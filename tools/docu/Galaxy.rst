Usage of dnpatterntools v1.0 in Galaxy
----------------------------------------

This document explains steps and interface 
of the dnpatterntools v1.0 usage in Galaxy.
The Galaxy xml wrappers of tools were tested 
in Planemo. The following summary is based on 
Planemo configured Galaxy server. The example data
is available in the *test-data* folder. 

Figure 1 illustrates the owerall Galaxy worklflow.

    Figure 1. Galaxy workflow of dinucleotide frequency pattern computation from a batch of nucleosomes fasta sequences. 

Step 1. Upload data

Figure 2 shows mouse nucleosomes fasta sequences uploaded into Galaxy. The tool panel shows all dnpattern tools.

Step 2. Compute dinucleotide frequency of occurrences

Figure 3 shows **Dinucleotide frequences** tool interface. The input is mouse nucleosomes fasta sequences uploaded into Galaxy.
Frequency profiles will be computed for all 16 dinucleotides on forward and complementary sequences. Figure 4 shows a plot of 
computed frequency profiles. Only 16 columns were plotted. The **Plot columns** tool is an extra tool for a rapid visualizaton.

Step 3. Compute correlations of dinucleotide frequency profiles in each poition along a fasta sequence

Figure 5 shows **Correlations** tool interface. Input data for correlations tools is dinucleotides frequency
profiles computed in  Step 2. Correlations are computed for all dinucleotides. Figure 6 shows output of the 
**Correlations** tool. The first column named "0" in each row contains average correlation of all dinucleotides. 
In the data section - data **5. Correlations on data 2**  contains output showing dinucleotide, its position of 
maximum positive corelation and a value of maximum positive correlation. The maximum correlation position of 
specific dinucleotides close to a cleavage site identifies a start of a nucleosome in nucleosome's dna sequences. 
This step can't be fully automated and needs visual inspection. In this example the nucleosome's starts 
at a position 25. The AA and TT had very prominent maximums at that position. Figure 7 shows a plot of correlations.

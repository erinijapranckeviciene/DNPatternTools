dnpatterntools v1.0 
---------------------

A set of tools to analyze patterns of dinucleotide distributions in nucleosomal DNA fasta sequences. 

Most often, computation of these features is implemented individually which makes difficult to compare and reproduce results obtained in different projects. This repository contains tools to convert fasta sequences into binary strings of 
dinucleotide occurrences, to compute dinucleotide frequencies of occurrence in a batch of aligned fasta
sequences, to compute correlations between patterns of dinucleotide distributions in nucleosomes DNA, to smooth patterns and to compute their periodogramms.

How to use
---------------------

Core utilities are written in C++ using the `SeqAn library <https://seqan.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_  and can be installed on Linux system by conda::

    conda install dnp-binstrings  -c bioconda
    conda install dnp-diprofile   -c bioconda
    conda install dnp-corrprofile -c bioconda
    conda install dnp-fourier     -c bioconda

To build core utilities from source::

    cd <your working dir>
    git clone https://github.com/erinijapranckeviciene/dnpatterntools.git
    cd dnpatterntools
    
and follow  `instructions <https://github.com/erinijapranckeviciene/dnpatterntools/blob/master/source/README.txt>`_ . 

The dnpatterntools are freely available as a  `dockerized galaxy instance <https://hub.docker.com/r/erinija/dnpatterntools-galaxy>`_ which runs on any local machine with the `docker <https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/>`_ installed. This instance contains demo data and demo workflow.   

On this site the fully functional Galaxy wrappers are provided in the *tools* folder. On Linux machine use a  
`planemo serve <https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html>`_ from within cloned *~/dnpatterntools/tools* folder. It will launch a ready to use dnpatterntools Galaxy instance. The `galaxy-workflow.pdf <https://github.com/erinijapranckeviciene/dnpatterntools/blob/master/galaxy-workflow.pdf
>`_ explains how to use tools in Galaxy.

General workflow 
------------------------

Complete dnpaterntools workflow has following steps:
   
   1. Computation of dinucleotide frequency distributions in a batch of aligned sequences. 
      
   2. Determining a nucleosome location from the dinucleotide frequency distributions.  
      
   3. Symmetrization and computation of composite distributions of WW/SS (W = A or T and S=C or G) 
      and RR/YY (R=A or G and Y=C or T) dinucleotides. 

   4. Normalization and smoothing of the dinucleotide frequency distribution patterns in nucleosomes
      and computing their periodograms.

Workflow steps and tools required in each step are shown in Figure 1.

The *tools* folder contains tools that implement complete workflow to obtain and characterize dinucleotide 
patterns in a batch of fasta sequences. The tools are written in *shell* and depends on the core tools. 
Each tool has an associated  galaxy *xml* wrapper with the same name. The Galaxy wrappers have been tested and served 
using Planemo (to be submitted to the Galaxy ToolShed). Below is a summary of the tools:

The *test* folder contains shell scripts of test calls to the core programs and *dnp* tools. 

The *tools-extra* folder contains bioconda-recipes for the core tools. 
The *ggplot-scripts* contains *R* functions to visualize the tools outputs. 

How to run scripts
-----------------------

Download the repository or use *git clone*. Follow building instructions in the *source* folder. 
If core programs are already installed, then descend into *test* directory to run tests. Run the 
*test-dependencies.sh* to test the core programs. Run *test_tools.sh* to test tools. The test data files 
are in *tools/test-data* folder. A standard use is described in a workflow. However, these tools 
may have a wider scope of application.
